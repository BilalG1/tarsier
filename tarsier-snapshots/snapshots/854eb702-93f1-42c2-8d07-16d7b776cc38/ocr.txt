				     [ 58 ]  We   got an  experience   . We  took  an  idea of  customer   to start his  dropshiping    e - commerce   and
				     brand  .
				     [ 59 ] In  two  weeks   we  made    a identity  and  project  visual  concept  . He  went  to the  bank  and  took  a  credit
				     in several  dozens   of  euro . In a few  months    project  successfully   launched    and  working   till this days .
				     [ 60 ] Thats  a  great example    with  own   pluses   and  minuses   but  it works .
