                                              [ 200 ] I'm interested in questions like ...
                                              [ 201 ] How do humans perform [ 204 ] semantic composition [ 202 ] ] and how can we build [ @ 205 ] systems [ @ 206 ] that

                                             NLP - is something about the self - attention mechanism inherently effective at expressing semantic composition?
                                              [ 210 ] How do humans [ 214 ] ground language [ 211 ] in their environment and how can we build systems that understand language

                                             perception & action modalities influence semantic representations?
                                              [ 222 ] What is the underlying relationship between [ 225 ] symbolic and statistical [ @ 226 ] approaches [ 223 ]? Why do some parts of
                                             nature seem so [ @ 227 ] perfectly described [ 224 ] by symbolic relations while others don't? Is reality fundamentally symbolic or are
                                             symbols a formalism that humans apply to our environment?
                                              [ 228 ] And a few miscellaneous ones: What makes specifically human brains so good at manipulating symbols, genetically, structurally,
                                             and culturally? How does the brain represent non - linguistic thoughts and is all perception [ @ 232 ] symbolic at some level [ 229 ]? How
                                             can classical theories from linguistics and [ @ 233 ] philosophy of language [ 230 ] aid modern research in NLP? Is internality an inherent
                                              [ @ 234 ] property of matter [ 231 ]?
