                                    [ 41 ] 1 ) How many classes / credits per term is considered" fulltime"?

                                    [ 42 ] 2 ) How do you think being Unclassified for 1 term ( Jan 2012 ) - completing 12 prerequisite credits would look ... if I am planning on being accepted to a
                                   degree in May 2012?

                                    [ 43 ] Just put those credits towards my new degree?
                                    [ 44 ] Do you think this would hurt me ...
                                    [ 45 ] Anyone accepted been in a similar situation?

                                    [ 46 ] Thanks so much [ @ 47 ]

                                    [ 48 ] from ubc website:
                                    [ 49 ] ]" Generally, we do not recommend repeating courses to improve your overall GPA. Students who enroll in unclassified, non - degree programs for the sole

                                    [ 58 ] I don't think that completing prerequisite courses as unclassified would necessarily make your application look bad. In that scenario you are at least
                                   studying a coherent line of school work. That part of the FAQ refers to individuals who primarily take" bird" courses to increase their GPA.

                                    [ 59 ] That being said, it's always good to email adcom and see what they think.

                                    [ 60 ] Good luck.

                                    [ 67 ] Hi there;
               **A**
                                    [ 68 ] In first year I did 8 courses, In second year I did 9 during the academic year ( and 1 during the summer ), and I did 9 in third year ( and 2 during the summer ).

                                    [ 69 ] I had a reduced course load because I was dealing with serious family issues and then grieving the death of an immediate family member that I was very
                                   close to. Along with the grief I had symptoms of depression ( and this is well documented ).

                                    [ 70 ] However, I did manage to maintain a 95 % average / 3.99 GPA while taking rigorous courses.

                                    [ 71 ] Do you think I need to demonstrate 10 courses an academic year before applying to UBC?

                                    [ 72 ] I have a three - year BSc degree, and I am considering taking this next year away from university to gain extra - curricular experience and hopefully earn
                                   some money, but I am concerned that applying to UBC with no full - time years on my transcript may be hopeless.


                                    [ 73 ] Thanks for your input.

                                    [ 82 ] Are you IP? Yes, you should definitely give it a shot, don't worry too much about the full time thing. A person who averages 95 % in 8 and 9 courses isn't
                                   going to drop to a 60 % by taking 1 more course

                                    [ 89 ] I think you should contact UBC about whether or not they care about taking 24 or 27 credits rather than 30. I took 25 credits in 2nd year and ended up
                                   fine. A 95 % average is pretty ridiculous even for OOP let alone IP, so I think you should definitely apply.

                                    [ 98 ] I guess my concerns about the reduced course load mostly stems from the fact that some of the other Canadian medical schools list a full - course load for
                                   at least one year as an absolute requirement, so I thought perhaps very few students with a reduced course load make into UBC even though they state on
                                   their admission site that it is not technically necessary.

                                    [ 99 ] Anyways, I will take the advice of emailing UBC, and will later post their reply in here in case it is helpful for other students with similar concerns.

                                    [ 100 ] Thanks again.
